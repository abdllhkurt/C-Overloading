# What is method overloading?

  In C#, two or more methods can have the same name if they differ in parameters (different number of parameters, different types of parameters, or both). This situation is called "Overloading" in the methods.
  
  The purpose here is to use the method name that will perform the same operation with different parameters all at once. Overloading is also widely used in "Object Oriented Programming".
